## Rule
Swing the phone to control the gray ball to hit other balls.

If you hit the green ball, the gray ball becomes larger and score +1.

If you hit the blue ball, the gray ball returns to its original size and scores +2.

If you hit the yellow ball, the red ball in a certain range is eliminated, and the score is increased to the number of eliminated red ball +1.

If you hit the red ball, the game is over.
